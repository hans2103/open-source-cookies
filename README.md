## Open vs closed source
Software is a sort of recipe with instructions that tell a computer what to do.
Most software is distributed with a license, a legal document that explains how you can use the software.
You have to accept those rules before being able to use the software.

There's a difference between closed and open source software:
- **Closed source software**: The software license protects the developerâ€™s rights and has rules that limit what the user can do.
  Users do not have access to the source code of the software and cannot make any changes.
  Because every license is different, users need to read the license carefully to know what they can and cannot do.
-  **Open source software**: It allows users to see the code, make changes, and share the software with others.
   Many open source software use a common license.
   This is simpler for users because if they already know the common license, they don't need to read it fully again.
